<p>Below, you can find a JSON-formatted list of some of the known security-relevant bugs in the
Solidity compiler. The file itself is hosted in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/bugs.json">Github repository</a>.
The list stretches back as far as version 0.3.0, bugs known to be present only
in versions preceding that are not listed.</p>
<p>There is another file called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/bugs_by_version.json">bugs_by_version.json</a>,
which can be used to check which bugs affect a specific version of the compiler.</p>
<p>Contract source verification tools and also other tools interacting with
contracts should consult this list according to the following criteria:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>It is mildly suspicious if a contract was compiled with a nightly
compiler version instead of a released version. This list does not keep
track of unreleased or nightly versions.</li>
<li>It is also mildly suspicious if a contract was compiled with a version that was
not the most recent at the time the contract was created. For contracts
created from other contracts, you have to follow the creation chain
back to a transaction and use the date of that transaction as creation date.</li>
<li>It is highly suspicious if a contract was compiled with a compiler that
contains a known bug and the contract was created at a time where a newer
compiler version containing a fix was already released.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The JSON file of known bugs below is an array of objects, one for each bug,
with the following keys:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>name</dt>
<dd>Unique name given to the bug</dd>
<dt>summary</dt>
<dd>Short description of the bug</dd>
<dt>description</dt>
<dd>Detailed description of the bug</dd>
<dt>link</dt>
<dd>URL of a website with more detailed information, optional</dd>
<dt>introduced</dt>
<dd>The first published compiler version that contained the bug, optional</dd>
<dt>fixed</dt>
<dd>The first published compiler version that did not contain the bug anymore</dd>
<dt>publish</dt>
<dd>The date at which the bug became known publicly, optional</dd>
<dt>severity</dt>
<dd>Severity of the bug: very low, low, medium, high. Takes into account
discoverability in contract tests, likelihood of occurrence and
potential damage by exploits.</dd>
<dt>conditions</dt>
<dd>Conditions that have to be met to trigger the bug. Currently, this
is an object that can contain a boolean value <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">optimizer</span></code>, which
means that the optimizer has to be switched on to enable the bug.
If no conditions are given, assume that the bug is present.</dd>
